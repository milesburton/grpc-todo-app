I'll help make the README more friendly and streamline its structure. Here's an improved version:

# Welcome to gRPC ToDo App! ðŸ‘‹

Hey there! This is a fun little project that shows how to build a ToDo application using gRPC and TypeScript. It's perfect for learning how microservices work in practice.

## Quick Links
- **GitHub:** [milesburton/grpc-todo-app](https://github.com/milesburton/grpc-todo-app)
- **License:** [MIT License](./LICENSE)

## Let's Get Started!

Getting up and running is super easy:

1. First, grab all the dependencies:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

2. Next, compile the protobuf definitions:
   ```bash
   npm run proto:compile
   ```

3. Finally, fire up the server (it'll run on port 50051):
   ```bash
   npm start
   ```

And that's it - you're ready to go! ðŸš€

## Using VS Code? We've Got You Covered!

This project comes with a Dev Container configuration for VS Code. What does this mean for you? When you open the project, VS Code will automatically set up a development environment with everything you need - Node.js, the protobuf compiler, and all the right extensions. No manual setup required!

To use it, just open the project in VS Code and it'll prompt you to reopen in a container. Click "Reopen in Container" and VS Code will handle the rest.

Happy coding! If you run into any issues or have questions, feel free to open an issue on GitHub. ðŸ˜Š
